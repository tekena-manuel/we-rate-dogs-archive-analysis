    "The next significant set of problems I faced was during the cleaning stage. In my attempt to clean the rating denominator I finally got the code to work(to every number not equal to 10 and change it to 10) without any error message but when I run a test code nothing seemed to have changed I was stuck here for a couple of days until I realized I was testing with the original dataset instead of the copied dataset. The next cleaning difficulty I had was changing the datatype of timestamp to DateTime. I couldn't get the code to work I kept getting this error “<class 'function'> is not convertible to DateTime” I  referred to a lot of websites that kept offering solutions but none of them worked. Tolu my session lead suggested I separate the date from the time in two different columns as I attempted to do this I realized the data in timestamp was compromised (it had changed to something else I didn't know how or why) so I copied the code I was running to a different notebook on the same table and it worked because of this I had to start afresh because the notebook I was working on seemed to have some of the data corrupted. <br />\n",
